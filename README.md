### Invoice Module Documentation

This documentation outlines the process of creating an invoice module suitable for use within a company. The module will include an HTML form for capturing user details and item information, a database setup to store user and invoice details, and functionalities such as live search and dynamic row insertion.

#### Step 1: HTML Form Creation

Create an HTML form that enables employees to input necessary details for generating invoices. This form should be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing for efficient data entry.

#### Step 2: Database Setup

Set up a database structure tailored to company needs. Create tables, such as `user_details` and `invoice_details`, to store employee information and invoice data, respectively. Ensure that the database design aligns with company requirements and facilitates efficient data management.

#### Step 3: Live Search Functionality

Implement live search functionality to streamline the process of retrieving employee details from the database. This feature enhances user experience by enabling quick and accurate data retrieval as users type.

#### Step 4: Dynamic Rows for Item Details

Integrate dynamic row functionality into the form, allowing employees to enter item details such as service, quantity, unit price, and total price. The ability to add or remove rows dynamically improves usability and accommodates varying invoice requirements.

#### Implementation Details

- Technologies Used: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MySQL Database.
- Dependencies: Depending on project specifications, additional dependencies may be required for backend development (e.g., Django).
